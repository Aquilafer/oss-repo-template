| Licensing              | 2     | Nyx uses the GPLv3 open source license.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Language               | 2     | Nyx is mostly written in Python with which I have much experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Level of Activity      | 2     |  There have been commits in all of the past four quarters, though activity varies greatly per month. Commits from most to least recent quarters: 1, 18, 12, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Number of Contributors | 2     | There are 13 total contributors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Project Size           | 1     | Nyx has 16654 lines of code according to gitstats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Issue Tracker          | 1     |  Because Nyx is not on github, there was no easy way for me to track the issues. I scored based from what I could find from a bug tracker for the project [1] and the developer's blog [2]. The bug tracker has 9 listed bugs, but none have yet been closed. The third one is about a crash on the FreeBSD OS when the user uses the "m" hotkey to open the menu. |
| New Contributor        | 2     |  Nyx has a website [3] and an active dev blog [2] with a FAQ  including steps on how to get involved. The most recent developer joined in 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| User Base              | 2     |  Nyx seems to have a decent user base with many unaffiliated blogs talking about its use found after a quick Google.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
