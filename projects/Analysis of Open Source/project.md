| Licensing              | 2     | Nyx uses the GPLv3 open source license.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Language               | 2     | Nyx is mostly written in Python with which I have much experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Level of Activity      | 2     | There have been commits in all of the past four quarters, though activity varies greatly per month. Commits from most to least recent quarters: 1, 18, 12, 2                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Number of Contributors | 2     | Nyx has 13 total contributors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Project Size           | 1     | Nyx has 16654 lines of code according to gitstats.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Issue Tracker          | 1     | Because Nyx is not on github, there was no easy way for me to track the issues. I scored based from what I could find from a bug tracker for the project [1] and the developer's blog [2]. The bug tracker has 9 listed bugs, but none have yet been closed. The third one is about a crash on the FreeBSD OS when the user uses the "m" hotkey to open the menu. |
| New Contributor        | 2     | Nyx has a website [3] and an active dev blog [2] with a FAQ  including steps on how to get involved. The most recent developer joined in 2018.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| User Base              | 2     | Nyx seems to have a decent user base with many unaffiliated blogs talking about its use found after a quick Google.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

|------------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Licensing              | 2     | CCE uses an MIT open source license.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Language               | 2     | CCE is mostly (81%) written in python.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Level of Activity      | 2     | CCE has been active in the past two quarters since it was made.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Number of Contributors | 0     | There are only two contributors.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Project Size           | 2     | Although gitstats claims that CCE has over 42000 lines of code, a quick appraisal of the commits shows that almost all of that is probably a library or something while the actual user line count is almost certainly < 1000.      |
| Issue Tracker          | 1     | There is only one listed issue and it is a question on how to install. It has been promptly answered which suggests that the lack of issues is due to the low user count.                                                           |
| New Contributor        | 0     |  There is no website or any kind of text showing how to join the project. It seems like the duo is comfortable doing this alone.                                                                                                    |
| User Base              | 1     |  Like I mentioned earlier, some people seem to be using it, and there are installation instructions, but the user base is obviously very small and the instructions amount to "download our code and manually run the python file". |
