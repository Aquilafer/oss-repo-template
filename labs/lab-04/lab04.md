Without a license, people and companies will avoid using the code because
of the uncertian legal repurcussions sourounding the use of the code. Also,
without a license, the user does not actually have any specific control over
the use of their own code; at least, until the user establishes a license.

Without clear legal guidelines outlining the proper use, one cannot be certian
that the code will always be freely accessible. The writer could effectively
add any restrictive license at any time which could ruin any infastructure
built around use of that specific program.
