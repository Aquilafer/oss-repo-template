Without a license, people and companies will avoid using the code because
of the uncertian legal repurcussions sourounding the use of the code. Also,
without a license, the user does not actually have any specific control over
the use of their own code; at least, until the user establishes a license.

Without clear legal guidelines outlining the proper use, one cannot be certian
that the code will always be freely accessible. The writer could effectively
add any restrictive license at any time which could ruin any infastructure
built around use of that specific program.

Gopher's failure to quickly adapt caused by its lack of openness possible
contributors probably did contribute to Gopher's collapse although, as the 
rest of the article points out, Gopher had many other problems going for it.
To blame any one flaw with Gopher for its downfall would be like finding

Android, being a modified version of the Linux kernel, must be open source
due to the restrictions of Linux's GPLv2 License which dictates that derivative
software must also remain licensed under the GPLv2 license. Linux is open
source to emulate Unix while it was distributed freely after the original
Unix software was brought back under proprietary license.
