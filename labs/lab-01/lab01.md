## Reading Assignments
### Open Source Definition
The gist of the definition is open distribution of a program and its source code for others to use and modify. Many of the definitions are further clarifications on that point.

### Smart Questions
- Be aware of what the user is asking. Too often, I have seen people answer a similar problem to what the questioner is asking (or more likely posting a link to an answer) without actually answering the actual problem. Be aware that sometimes the question isn't about how to solve A or B, but how to do them together which is not always as simple as either A or B.
- Watch out for assumptions you might make due to your own perspective. Just because something is trivial to you doesn't mean it is that way for everybody.
- Make the answers both simple and complete. This depends a lot on the audience, but be aware that most newer users are probably not too familiar with most of the more technical stuff and would appriciate either an answer that does not assume much technical experience or an explanation for the steps separating the technical nature of the solution from its complex appearance.

### Free Culture
What I got out of this article is that copywrite law is broken. The first point is that Jesse Jordan shouldn't have been the focus of the lawsuit. He himself did not pirate music and it is ludicrous to assume that he should have better monitored the files he stored. I mean, he had millions of files; if a copyright holder could sue any site housing user-posted copyrighted content, just about every site that accepts user-posted content is at risk of suit. It seems the only reason Jesse was sued was because he was the easiest target/scrapegoat. Second, the RIAA did not notify that Jesse's server had pirated content or ask him to take down any infringing files. If the RIAA was really interested in safeguarding copywrited content, they would have first asked that some effort first be made to handle the problem. Third, suits must be for realistic damages. It is laughable to even consider that Jesse caused $150,000 of damages total, much less per infringement. Fourth, Jesse had no say in the result in the lawsuit as would be too costly for all but the richest to oppose. In conclusion, the evident purpose of copyright protection seems less to protect artistic works and more to leach money from unfortunate people.

## Reflection
I am searching for a project by thinking about things that I want to do that I have not been able to find an easy way to do. I think I have found an interesting potential project in emulating 16-bit windows. I find it extremely annoying that modern Windows does not support my old 16-bit games that I used to play and virtual machines of Windows XP can run really slowly. I would like it if there was something like DOSBox, easy to install and use, for running 16-bit stuff. I do worry about the difficulty of this project as it will likely require extensive knowledge in 16-bit assembly.
